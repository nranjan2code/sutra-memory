# Revolutionary AI System Dependencies
# Clean, minimal dependencies for maximum efficiency

# Core API Framework
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
pydantic==2.5.0

# Lightweight ML (for hybrid approach - OPTIONAL but recommended)
# Only 22MB model, runs on CPU!
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2  # For semantic embeddings (OPTIONAL)
numpy>=1.24.0  # For vector operations

# Optional: Enhanced NLP (if needed)
# nltk==3.8.1
# spacy==3.7.2

# Development and Testing
pytest==7.4.3
httpx==0.25.2
requests==2.31.0

# HYBRID APPROACH:
# - Works WITHOUT sentence-transformers (pure graph-based)
# - Works BETTER WITH sentence-transformers (semantic understanding)
# - NO massive LLMs, NO billions of parameters, NO expensive GPUs
# - Just a tiny 22MB model that runs on any laptop!
