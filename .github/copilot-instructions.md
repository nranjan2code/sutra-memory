# Sutra AI - AI Assistant Instructions

**Domain-Specific Explainable AI System for Regulated Industries**

## Project Architecture

Sutra AI is a **12-service distributed system** that provides explainable reasoning over domain-specific knowledge graphs. Unlike general LLMs, it starts empty and learns from YOUR proprietary data (medical protocols, legal precedents, financial regulations) with complete audit trails.

### Core Components

**Storage Layer (Rust):**
- `sutra-storage` - High-performance graph storage with Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability
- Binary TCP protocol for low-latency communication
- USearch HNSW vector indexing with persistent mmap (94x faster startup)
- Cross-shard 2PC transactions, adaptive reconciliation

**Reasoning Engine (Python):**
- `sutra-core` - Graph traversal with Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA)
- Real-time learning without retraining
- Quality gates: "I don't know" responses when confidence < threshold
- Progressive streaming with confidence-based refinement

**API & Services:**
- `sutra-api` (FastAPI) - REST endpoints on :8000
- `sutra-hybrid` - Semantic orchestration on :8001  
- `sutra-embedding-service` - HA embedding cluster (3 replicas + HAProxy) on :8888
- `sutra-bulk-ingester` (Rust) - High-throughput data ingestion on :8005

## Essential Workflows

### Build System (2025-11-03)
```bash
# Build all services (single :latest tag strategy)
SUTRA_EDITION=simple sutra build                        # 8 services (4.4GB)
SUTRA_EDITION=enterprise sutra build                    # 10 services (4.76GB)

# Check what was built
sutra status

# Build individual service
SUTRA_EDITION=simple sutra build storage
```

**Image Tagging:**
- All services: `sutra-<service>:${SUTRA_VERSION:-latest}`
- Single tag strategy (no `:latest-optimized` or intermediate tags)
- Compose file: `.sutra/compose/production.yml`

### Deployment System
```bash
# Deploy by edition (profile-based)
SUTRA_EDITION=simple sutra deploy         # 8 services
SUTRA_EDITION=community sutra deploy      # HA configuration
SUTRA_EDITION=enterprise sutra deploy     # 10 services with grid

# Check status
sutra status                               # Overall health
docker ps                                  # Raw Docker status
```

**Service Breakdown:**
- **Simple/Community**: 8 services (storage, api, hybrid, embedding, nlg, bulk-ingester, client, control)
- **Enterprise**: +2 grid services (grid-master, grid-agent)

### Release Management (2025-11-03)
```bash
sutra version                      # Show current version (3.0.0)
# Note: Release management moved to sutra-deploy.sh (backend)
./sutra-deploy.sh release patch    # Bug fix release (2.0.0 → 2.0.1)
./sutra-deploy.sh release minor    # Feature release (2.0.0 → 2.1.0)
./sutra-deploy.sh release major    # Breaking changes (2.0.0 → 3.0.0)
git push origin main --tags        # Trigger automated builds
sutra deploy                       # Deploy current version
```

### Development Testing
```bash
# Full integration test
PYTHONPATH=packages/sutra-core python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Production smoke test (validates embeddings)
sutra test smoke

# Integration test (validates container deployment)
sutra test integration

# Validation test (validates Docker images)
sutra validate

# Rust tests (WAL recovery, 2PC transactions)
cd packages/sutra-storage && cargo test
```

### Security Modes
- **Development (default):** No auth/encryption - localhost only
- **Production:** `SUTRA_SECURE_MODE=true` - TLS 1.3, HMAC-SHA256, RBAC
- Security code **FULLY INTEGRATED** as of October 2025

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Unified Learning Pipeline
**Critical:** Storage server owns complete learning process. ALL data ingestion routes through TCP `learn_concept()`:
```rust
// packages/sutra-storage/src/services/learning_service.rs
pub async fn learn_concept(&mut self, content: String) -> Result<ConceptId> {
    let embedding = self.embedding_client.generate(content).await?;
    let associations = self.extract_associations(&content)?;
    self.store_atomically(content, embedding, associations).await
}
```

### Multi-Language Workspace
- **Rust:** High-performance storage, grid infrastructure, bulk ingestion
- **Python:** AI reasoning, APIs, UIs (except React components)
- **Cargo workspace:** `packages/sutra-{storage,protocol,grid-*,bulk-ingester}`  
- **Python packages:** `packages/sutra-{core,api,hybrid,client,control}`

### Edition System
```bash
SUTRA_EDITION=simple|community|enterprise
# Affects: feature availability, shard count, embedding model selection
# See: docker-compose profiles and license validation
```

### TCP Binary Protocol (Not gRPC)
Custom MessagePack-based protocol for low latency:
```rust
// packages/sutra-protocol/src/messages.rs
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum StorageRequest {
    LearnConcept { content: String, metadata: Option<ConceptMetadata> },
    QueryGraph { query: String, max_paths: u32 },
    GetConcept { concept_id: ConceptId },
}
```

**Architectural Policy:** Sutra will NEVER support SQL, Cypher, or GraphQL (see `docs/architecture/NO_SQL_POLICY.md`).

## Integration Points

### Embedding Service HA Architecture
- HAProxy load balancer (`:8888`) → 3 embedding replicas (`:8889-8891`)
- Automatic failover, health checks every 30s
- Storage server connects via `SUTRA_EMBEDDING_SERVICE_URL`

### Cross-Shard Coordination  
- Grid Master (`:7001`) orchestrates 4-16 storage shards
- 2PC coordinator for atomic writes across shards
- Parallel vector search queries all shards simultaneously

### Self-Monitoring with Grid Events
System monitors itself using its own reasoning engine:
```python
# Query operational state in natural language
"Which services are consuming the most CPU?"
"Show me failed requests in the last hour"
# Answers come from Grid Events stored in concept graph
```

## Release Management System

### Overview
Professional version control for customer deployments with centralized versioning and automated builds.

### Key Files
- **VERSION** - Single source of truth for all package versions (2.0.0)
- **sutra-deploy.sh** - Release commands (version, release, deploy)
- **docker-compose-grid.yml** - All services use `${SUTRA_VERSION:-latest}`
- **.github/workflows/release.yml** - Automated builds on tag push
- **docs/release/** - Complete documentation (5 docs, 44KB)

### Common Release Tasks

**Check version:**
```bash
sutra version                      # Show current version (3.0.0)
cat VERSION                        # 3.0.0
```

**Create release:**
```bash
# Bug fixes
./sutra-deploy.sh release patch    # 2.0.0 → 2.0.1

# New features
./sutra-deploy.sh release minor    # 2.0.0 → 2.1.0

# Breaking changes
./sutra-deploy.sh release major    # 2.0.0 → 3.0.0
```

**What happens:**
1. VERSION file updated
2. README.md badge updated
3. Git commit created
4. Git tag created (e.g., v2.0.1)
5. User pushes: `git push origin main --tags`
6. GitHub Actions builds all images
7. Docker images tagged and pushed to registry

**Deploy version:**
```bash
sutra deploy                       # Deploy current version
```

### Semantic Versioning
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  │     │     │
  │     │     └─ Bug fixes (backward compatible)
  │     └─────── New features (backward compatible)
  └───────────── Breaking changes
```

### Documentation
- **docs/release/README.md** - Overview and navigation
- **docs/release/RELEASE_PROCESS.md** - Complete workflow (500+ lines)
- **docs/release/QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Command cheat sheet
- **docs/release/VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md** - When to bump versions
- **docs/release/SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Implementation details

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't bypass unified learning:** All ingestion MUST go through storage server TCP protocol
- **Don't use generic AI advice:** This is domain-specific reasoning, not general chatbot
- **Don't ignore editions:** Features/performance vary significantly by SUTRA_EDITION
- **Don't assume security:** Default mode has NO authentication (development only)
- **Don't forget WAL:** Storage operations are transactional with crash recovery
- **Don't manually edit VERSION:** Use `./sutra-deploy.sh release <type>` for version bumps
- **Don't skip release docs:** See `docs/release/` for complete release workflow
- **Don't use removed scripts:** Use `sutra` command as single entry point, not external scripts

## Scale Targets

- **Startup:** Fast loading with persistent HNSW indexes
- **Target scale:** 10M+ concepts across 16 shards
- **Architecture:** Optimized for continuous learning workloads

When working on this codebase, prioritize explainability, audit trails, and domain-specific accuracy over general AI capabilities. Every reasoning path should be traceable for compliance requirements.
