## 📚 Enhanced English Curriculum

### **Curriculum Quality**
- **111 total lessons** (vs 40+ in original)
- **5 progressive skill levels** (Foundation → Proficient)
- **Comprehensive content** with semantic relationships
- **Clear prerequisites** and learning objectives

### **Skill Level Breakdown**
```
Level 1: Foundation (33 lessons) - Alphabet, phonics, letter sounds
Level 2: Elementary (66 lessons) - Vocabulary, word types, parts of speech  
Level 3: Intermediate (6 lessons) - Grammar, sentence structure, tenses
Level 4: Advanced (3 lessons) - Complex sentences, conditionals, modals
Level 5: Proficient (3 lessons) - Idioms, figurative language, formal register
```

### **Content Examples**
**Enhanced Vowel Lesson:**
```
"Vowels are the letters A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. They form the core sounds 
of syllables and are essential for pronunciation. 

Examples: 
- A: sounds like 'ay' in 'day', 'ah' in 'cat', or 'aw' in 'ball'
- E: sounds like 'ee' in 'see', 'eh' in 'bed', or silent in 'make'
- I: sounds like 'eye' in 'pie', 'ih' in 'sit', or 'ee' in 'machine'"
```
