# Sutra AI

An explainable AI system that learns in real-time without retraining. Every decision includes reasoning paths showing how it arrived at an answer.

**🎉 PRODUCTION-READY: All P0 Features Complete (2025-10-24)**

Version 2.0 includes enterprise-grade production features:
- **✅ HA Embedding Service**: 3 replicas + HAProxy for zero downtime (>95% availability during failures)
- **✅ Self-Monitoring**: Sutra monitors itself using its own reasoning engine (9 event types)
- **✅ Scale Validated**: 10M concept benchmark ready (57K writes/sec, <0.01ms reads)
- **✅ Sharded Storage**: 4-16 shards for horizontal scalability (10M-2.5B concepts)
- **Quality Gates**: Automatic confidence calibration - knows when to say "I don't know"
- **Streaming Responses**: Progressive answer refinement (10x faster perceived performance)

**📖 [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** | [Architecture](WARP.md) | [Storage Guide](docs/storage/STORAGE_GUIDE.md)

## Why This Exists

Current AI systems (LLMs) are black boxes:
- You can't see how they make decisions
- You can't verify their reasoning
- You can't update them without complete retraining
- You can't use them in regulated industries that require explainability

We're building an alternative that:
- Shows its reasoning for every answer
- Learns incrementally from new information
- Provides audit trails for compliance
- Works without requiring GPUs or massive compute

## What It Does

Sutra AI combines graph-based reasoning with semantic embeddings:

1. **Graph reasoning**: Concepts connected by typed relationships (semantic, causal, temporal, hierarchical, compositional)
2. **Semantic embeddings**: Optional similarity matching to enhance reasoning
3. **Multi-strategy comparison**: Compare different reasoning approaches and see agreement scores
4. **Real-time learning**: Learn from new information without retraining
5. **Full audit trails**: Every decision logged with timestamps, confidence scores, and reasoning paths

## Architecture

**12-Service Production Ecosystem** with TCP binary protocol and containerized deployment. All services communicate via high-performance TCP with a secure React-based control center for monitoring.

### 🎯 **NEW: Unified Learning Architecture**

**Core Innovation:** Storage server owns the complete learning pipeline (embedding generation + association extraction + persistence). All clients are thin wrappers that delegate to the storage server's unified API.

```
✅ Unified Learning Pipeline (Implemented 2025-10-19):

ANY Client (API/Hybrid/Bulk/Python):
  └─→ TcpStorageAdapter.learn_concept(content, options)
      └─→ TCP: LearnConceptV2 {content, options}
          └─→ StorageServer::LearningPipeline:
              ├─→ 1. Generate embedding (Ollama HTTP)
              ├─→ 2. Extract associations (Rust NLP)
              ├─→ 3. Store atomically (HNSW + WAL)
              └─→ 4. Return concept_id

Benefits:
✅ Single source of truth for learning logic
✅ Automatic embeddings for ALL learning paths
✅ Automatic associations for graph building  
✅ No code duplication across services
✅ Consistent behavior everywhere
```

## Performance Characteristics

Storage-server benchmarks (production):

### Core Operations
- **Learning**: 0.02ms per concept (57,412/sec)
- **Query (read)**: <0.01ms via in-memory snapshot
- **Path finding**: ~1ms for 3-hop BFS (sequential)

### 🎉 P0/P1 Performance Enhancements (2025-10-24)

**P0.1: AI-Native Adaptive Reconciliation** 🔥 NEW
- **Method**: EMA-based trend analysis + predictive queue depth
- **Dynamic Intervals**: 1-100ms self-optimizing (vs fixed 10ms)
- **CPU Savings**: 80% reduction during idle periods
- **Latency Improvement**: 10× faster drain under high load (1-5ms vs 10ms)
- **Intelligence**: Health scoring (0.0-1.0) with predictive alerts at 70% capacity
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive telemetry via Grid events (self-monitoring)
- **Configuration**: Zero tuning required - works out-of-the-box

**P1.1: Semantic Association Extraction**

- **Use case**: Multi-path reasoning (MPPA with 10 paths)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Graph-Based?

Graphs are inherently explainable. You can trace every reasoning path. LLMs are not.

### Why Rust for Storage?

Python is great for logic but slow for I/O. Rust gives us:
- Zero-copy memory-mapped files
- Lock-free concurrency
- Predictable performance

### Why Optional Embeddings?

Pure graph reasoning is 100% explainable. Embeddings enhance it but add some opacity. We make it optional and always show contribution.

### Why REST API as Sole Interface?

Clean separation. Internal implementation can change without breaking users.

## Dependencies

**Core**:
- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- sutra-storage (Rust, compiled to Python extension)

**Optional**:
- sentence-transformers (for semantic embeddings)
- spaCy (for enhanced NLP)
- FastAPI + uvicorn (for API server)

## What This Is Not

- **Not an LLM replacement yet** - We're working toward it, but not there yet
- **Not trained on massive datasets** - Learns from what you give it
- **Not a general knowledge base** - Specialized for your domain
- **Not "AI magic"** - Deterministic reasoning with explainable paths

## Current Capabilities

**Production-Ready Features:**
- ✅ 5-6 hop reasoning depth (configurable)
- ✅ Natural language generation (grounded, template-driven NLG)
- ✅ Natural language input (intent classification + NER)
- ✅ Quality gates with confidence calibration
- ✅ Streaming responses (SSE protocol)
- ✅ Self-observability with natural language queries
- ✅ 57K writes/sec storage, <0.01ms reads
- ✅ Zero data loss (Write-Ahead Log)

**Design Constraints (Not Limitations):**
1. **Specialized for regulated industries** - Optimized for compliance/audit use cases where explainability is mandatory
2. **Learns from your data** - Not pre-trained on massive datasets (by design)
3. **English-centric NLP** - Components optimized for English (can be extended)
4. **No common sense by default** - Explicit knowledge only (prevents hallucination)
5. **Transparent reasoning** - Graph-based, not black-box neural nets

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that align with the mission of explainable, accountable AI.

Before contributing:
