# Data Directory

This directory contains datasets and data files.

## Structure
- `raw/` - Original, immutable data
- `processed/` - Cleaned and processed data
- `external/` - Data from third-party sources

## Note
Data files are typically ignored by git due to size. Consider using DVC or similar tools for data versioning.
