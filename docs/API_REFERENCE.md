### Query Intent Classification

The system recognizes these query patterns:

| Intent Type | Patterns | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **what** | "what is", "what are", "what does" | "What is photosynthesis?" |
| **how** | "how does", "how do", "how can" | "How do plants make energy?" |
| **why** | "why does", "why is", "why are" | "Why is sunlight important?" |
| **when** | "when does", "when is" | "When does photosynthesis occur?" |
| **where** | "where is", "where does" | "Where does photosynthesis happen?" |
| **who** | "who is", "who does" | "Who discovered photosynthesis?" |

### Query Complexity Assessment

- **Simple queries** (definitions): +10% confidence boost
- **Complex multi-part queries** (>10 words): -5% confidence
- **Causal reasoning** (seeking causes): -10% confidence  
- **Comparison queries**: -15% confidence

### get_query_suggestions(partial_query, max_suggestions=5) → List[str]

Generate query suggestions based on partial input.

```python
suggestions = processor.get_query_suggestions("photosyn", max_suggestions=3)
# Returns: ["What is photosynthesis?", "How does photosynthesis work?", ...]
```
