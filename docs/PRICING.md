## ROI Calculator

### Example: Customer Support Knowledge Base

**Scenario:** 10-person support team, 100K support tickets/year

**Without Sutra:**
- Support time: 100K tickets × 5 min = 500K minutes = 8,333 hours
- Cost: 8,333 hours × $50/hour = $416,650/year

**With Sutra (Community):**
- Support time: 100K tickets × 2 min = 200K minutes = 3,333 hours (60% faster)
- Cost: 3,333 hours × $50/hour = $166,650/year
- Sutra cost: $99 × 12 = $1,188/year
- **Total savings: $248,812/year (60% reduction)**

**ROI:** 20,844% in year 1
