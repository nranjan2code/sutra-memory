# Delete Functionality in Sutra Desktop

**Version:** 3.3.0  
**Updated:** November 27, 2025

This document describes the comprehensive delete functionality implemented across Sutra Desktop's user interface.

---

## Overview

Sutra Desktop now supports permanent concept deletion from multiple screens with full data cleanup and durability guarantees. The deletion system follows the application's async architecture pattern while ensuring complete removal of all associated data.

## User Interface

### Knowledge Panel

**Location:** Main → Knowledge  
**Button:** 🗑️ next to each concept card

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────┐
│ 📎 Paris is the capital of France...           │ 🗑️   │
│    ID: a3f2e8c1    Confidence: 92.0%           │      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────┘
```

**Behavior:**
- Click 🗑️ → immediate deletion request
- Status bar shows "Deleting concept..."
- On success: concept disappears, knowledge count updates
- On error: error message displayed in status bar

### Quick Learn Panel

**Location:** Main → Search (Quick Learn)  
**Button:** 🗑️ next to successful "Recent learns" entries

```
📚 Recent learns:
✅ London is UK capital                           🗑️
✅ Tokyo is Japan capital                        🗑️
⏳ Learning "Berlin is Germany capital"
❌ Failed to learn invalid content
```

**Behavior:**
- Only successful entries show delete button
- Click 🗑️ → finds matching concept and deletes
- Entry disappears from recent learns list
- Knowledge count updates automatically

## Technical Architecture

### Storage Layer Implementation

The delete functionality is implemented in the `sutra-storage` crate:

```rust
// In packages/sutra-storage/src/concurrent_memory.rs
pub fn delete_concept(&self, concept_id: ConceptId) -> Result<u64, WriteLogError> {
    // 1. WAL logging for durability
    let operation = Operation::DeleteConcept { concept_id };
    let mut wal = self.wal.lock().unwrap();
    let _wal_sequence = wal.append(operation)?;
    
    // 2. WriteLog entry for immediate processing  
    let sequence_number = self.write_log.append(WriteEntry::DeleteConcept {
        id: concept_id,
        timestamp: current_timestamp(),
    })?;
    
    // 3. Remove from vector storage
    let mut vectors = self.vectors.write();
    vectors.remove(&concept_id);
    
    // 4. Remove from HNSW index (if supported)
    // Note: Currently commented out as HnswContainer may not support removal
    
    Ok(sequence_number)
}
```

### WAL Operations

Deletions are logged to the Write-Ahead Log for crash recovery:

```rust
// In packages/sutra-storage/src/wal.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq)]
pub enum Operation {
    WriteConcept { ... },
    WriteAssociation { ... },
    DeleteConcept { concept_id: ConceptId },  // NEW
    DeleteAssociation { ... },
    // ...
}
```

### Reconciler Processing

The adaptive reconciler handles delete operations during background processing:

```rust
// In packages/sutra-storage/src/adaptive_reconciler.rs
WriteEntry::DeleteConcept { id, timestamp: _ } => {
    if snapshot.concepts.contains_key(id) {
        snapshot.concepts.remove(id);
        
        // Remove all edges pointing to this concept from other concepts
        let mut updated_concepts = im::HashMap::new();
        for (other_id, other_node) in snapshot.concepts.iter() {
            if other_id != id {
                let mut node_clone = other_node.clone();
                node_clone.neighbors.retain(|neighbor| neighbor != id);
                updated_concepts.insert(*other_id, node_clone);
            }
        }
        snapshot.concepts = updated_concepts;
    }
}
```

## User Interface Implementation

### Action Definitions

New actions were added to handle delete requests:

```rust
// Knowledge panel actions
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum KnowledgeAction {
    Search(String),
    Refresh,
    SelectConcept(String),
    DeleteConcept(String),  // NEW
}

// Quick Learn panel actions  
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum QuickLearnAction {
    Learn(String),
    BatchLearn(Vec<String>),
    Delete(String),  // NEW - content-based deletion
}
```

### Async Message Handling

Deletion results are communicated via async messages:

```rust
// New message type for deletion results
AppMessage::ConceptDeleted { 
    concept_id: String, 
    success: bool, 
    error: Option<String> 
} => {
    if success {
        // Remove from UI lists, refresh knowledge, update stats
        self.handle_knowledge_action(KnowledgeAction::Refresh);
        self.refresh_stats();
        self.status_bar.set_activity("Concept deleted successfully");
    } else if let Some(err) = error {
        self.status_bar.set_activity(format!("Delete failed: {}", err));
    }
}
```

### UI Layout Changes

#### Knowledge Panel

The concept display was redesigned to accommodate delete buttons:

```rust
fn concepts_grid(&mut self, ui: &mut egui::Ui, action: &mut Option<KnowledgeAction>) {
    for concept in &concepts_clone {
        ui.horizontal(|ui| {
            // Main concept card area
            let card_width = ui.available_width() - 40.0;
            if self.render_concept_card(ui, concept) {
                *action = Some(KnowledgeAction::SelectConcept(concept.id.clone()));
            }
            
            // Delete button
            let delete_btn = egui::Button::new("🗑️").fill(Color32::TRANSPARENT);
            if ui.add(delete_btn).on_hover_text("Delete concept").clicked() {
                *action = Some(KnowledgeAction::DeleteConcept(concept.id.clone()));
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### Quick Learn Panel

Recent learns entries now include conditional delete buttons:

```rust
fn render_recent_learns(&mut self, ui: &mut egui::Ui, action: &mut Option<QuickLearnAction>) {
    for (i, entry) in self.recent_learns.iter().enumerate().rev().take(10) {
        ui.horizontal(|ui| {
            // Main entry content...
            
            // Delete button for successful entries only
            if matches!(entry.status, LearnStatus::Success) {
                let delete_btn = egui::Button::new("🗑️").fill(Color32::TRANSPARENT);
                if ui.add(delete_btn).clicked() {
                    *action = Some(QuickLearnAction::Delete(entry.content.clone()));
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Data Cleanup Guarantees

When a concept is deleted, the following cleanup occurs:

### ✅ Complete Cleanup
- **Concept Content**: Removed from main concept store
- **Metadata**: All associated metadata deleted
- **Edges**: All incoming and outgoing relationships removed
- **Vectors**: Embedding vectors removed from storage
- **Search Index**: Concept removed from text search indices
- **WAL Logging**: Deletion logged for crash recovery

### ⚠️ Partial Cleanup
- **HNSW Index**: May not support vector removal (implementation dependent)
- **External References**: Any external systems referencing concepts by ID

### 🔄 Consistency
- **Immediate**: WriteLog entry processed immediately
- **Eventual**: WAL replay ensures consistency after crashes
- **Atomic**: Either all cleanup succeeds or none (transaction-like behavior)

---

## Error Handling

### Storage Errors

```rust
match storage.delete_concept(concept_id) {
    Ok(_) => // Success path,
    Err(WriteLogError::Full) => // Backpressure - retry or fail gracefully,
    Err(WriteLogError::SystemError(msg)) => // WAL failure - show error,
    Err(WriteLogError::Disconnected) => // Internal error - restart required,
}
```

### UI Error Display

- **Status Bar**: Primary error display location
- **Chat Messages**: Secondary error display for chat-initiated deletions  
- **Logging**: All errors logged to console for debugging

### Recovery Scenarios

1. **Partial Delete**: If vector removal fails, concept still deleted from main storage
2. **WAL Failure**: Operation fails completely, no partial state
3. **UI State**: Auto-refresh ensures UI consistency after operations

---

## Performance Considerations

### Deletion Performance

- **Immediate**: UI updates happen instantly (non-blocking)
- **Background**: Actual deletion in dedicated thread
- **Batch**: Multiple deletes can be processed in sequence
- **Memory**: Deleted concepts immediately removed from memory

### Impact on Other Operations

- **Searches**: Deleted concepts immediately unavailable
- **Graph View**: Nodes removed, layout recalculated
- **Analytics**: Counters updated in real-time
- **Export**: Deleted concepts excluded from exports

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned (v3.4+)

1. **Bulk Delete**: Multi-select in Knowledge panel
2. **Undo Support**: Temporary deletion with recovery option  
3. **Soft Delete**: Mark as deleted instead of permanent removal
4. **Delete Confirmation**: Modal dialog for important concepts

### Considered (v4.0+)

1. **Recycle Bin**: Temporary storage for deleted concepts
2. **Audit Trail**: Track who deleted what and when
3. **Cascading Deletes**: Option to delete related concepts
4. **Export Before Delete**: Automatic backup of deleted concepts
