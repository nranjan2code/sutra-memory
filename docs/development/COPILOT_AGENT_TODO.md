## 🗺️ Development Roadmap (Priority Order)

### PHASE 1: ML Service Architecture (Week 1-4)
**Objective:** Extract ML services to separate repos for production-grade architecture  
**Why First:** Stable foundation before optimization and monitoring  
**Reference:** See `docs/architecture/ML_INFERENCE_THREE_REPO_STRATEGY.md` for complete strategy  
**Market Impact:** Independent scaling, reduced deployment time (20min → 10min)  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks (60-80 hours) - buffered for unknown sync effort

#### Phase 1 Prerequisites (COMPLETE BEFORE STARTING) ⚠️
**Effort:** 2 hours  
**Critical:** These must be done first to avoid blocking issues

**Checklist:**
- [ ] **Step 1:** Set up GitHub Container Registry authentication (30 min)
  - [ ] Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - [ ] Click "Generate new token (classic)"
  - [ ] Select scopes: `write:packages`, `read:packages`, `delete:packages`
  - [ ] Save token securely (1Password, etc.)
  - [ ] Test Docker login: `echo $GITHUB_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u nranjan2code --password-stdin`
  - [ ] Verify: `docker pull ghcr.io/nranjan2code/test:latest` (should authenticate, even if 404)
  
- [ ] **Step 2:** Clone and assess external repos (1 hour)
  - [ ] Clone sutra-embedder: `cd ~/tmp && git clone https://github.com/nranjan2code/sutra-embedder.git`
  - [ ] Check last commit: `cd sutra-embedder && git log -1 --date=short`
  - [ ] Check CI/CD exists: `ls -la .github/workflows/`
  - [ ] Clone sutraworks-model: `cd ~/tmp && git clone https://github.com/nranjan2code/sutraworks-model.git`
  - [ ] Check last commit: `cd sutraworks-model && git log -1 --date=short`
  - [ ] Check CI/CD exists: `ls -la .github/workflows/`
  
- [ ] **Step 3:** Assess sync effort (30 min)
  - [ ] If last commit > 30 days: Add 10-20 hours to Phase 1 estimate
  - [ ] If last commit > 90 days: Add 30-40 hours (consider rewrite)
  - [ ] If .github/workflows/ missing: Add 5-10 hours per repo
  - [ ] Document findings in session notes

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ ghcr.io authentication working (can push/pull)
- ✅ Both repos cloned and assessed
- ✅ Realistic sync effort estimated
- ✅ No blockers identified

  - [ ] Restart both replicas, verify recovery
  
- [ ] **Step 9:** Performance testing
  - [ ] Run stress test: `python3 scripts/stress_test.py --quick`
  - [ ] Verify throughput with HA: Should be ~3× single replica
  - [ ] Test with 1 replica down: Should be ~2× single replica
  - [ ] Document performance characteristics
  
- [ ] **Step 10:** Documentation
  - [ ] Update `docs/deployment/HA_CONFIGURATION.md`
  - [ ] Add HAProxy configuration guide
  - [ ] Document failover scenarios

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC PRIORITY: BUILD STABLE ARCHITECTURE, THEN MONITOR IT**

**The Killer Feature:** Sutra monitors itself using its own reasoning engine.

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ 26 Grid event types DEFINED (1659 LOC)
- ✅ EventEmitter infrastructure BUILT and INTEGRATED
- ⏳ Only 4/26 event types ACTIVELY EMITTED
- 🎯 Will emit all 26 events on FINAL production architecture (Phase 4)

**Why Monitor After Architecture Work:**
1. **Avoid Rework:** Don't emit events twice (before and after ML extraction)
2. **Better Demo:** Self-monitoring is MORE impressive on optimized HA system
3. **Event Quality:** Performance events meaningful AFTER optimization (25ms embeddings)
4. **HA Monitoring:** Failover events only relevant AFTER HA architecture complete
5. **Stable Foundation:** Emit all 26 events once on production-ready system

**Strategic Sequence:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3):** ML service extraction → Clean architecture foundation
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6):** ML optimization → 2× performance targets
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8):** HA validation → Production-grade availability
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 9-10):** Complete self-monitoring → Monitor final system, prove $20B thesis

- Deep review of TODO and architecture
- Corrected priority: Self-monitoring (Phase 0) is the killer feature and first priority
- Updated roadmap: All phases required, executed sequentially based on priority
- Focus: Complete Grid event emissions to prove $20B DevOps observability thesis

### Session 3 (November 19, 2025)
- Removed all "optional" language from TODO document
- Clarified: ALL phases are REQUIRED for production-grade system
- Phases are PRIORITIZED (sequential execution), not optional vs required
- Aligned with production philosophy: "No TODOs, no mocks, no stubs - all production-grade code"

### Session 4 (November 19, 2025)
- **Strategic reorganization:** Move self-monitoring (Phase 0) to AFTER architecture work (now Phase 4)
- **Rationale:** Monitor the FINAL production system, not one in transition - avoids rework
- **New sequence:** ML extraction → Optimization → HA validation → Self-monitoring (Phases 1-4)
- **Benefits:** Better demo (monitor optimized HA system), no rework on event emissions, events more meaningful
- **Self-monitoring remains KILLER FEATURE** - just smarter timing for implementation
- **Version targets updated:** v3.2.0 (ML extraction) → v3.3.0 (optimization) → v4.0.0 (HA) → v4.1.0 (monitoring)

### Session 6 (November 19, 2025) - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Advanced External Services Integration
- **CRITICAL INSIGHT:** We were confusing integration direction! 
- **CORRECT APPROACH:** Use advanced external repos to REPLACE simple monorepo services
- **WRONG APPROACH:** Modifying advanced external repos to match simple monorepo services
- **Strategic Clarity:** sutra-embedder (4x faster Rust) + sutraworks-model (enterprise AI) → Replace Python services
- **Task 1.1 COMPLETED:** Added production HTTP API to advanced sutra-embedder, published v1.0.0
- **Task 1.2 COMPLETED:** Added production HTTP API to advanced sutraworks-model, published v1.0.0
- **Integration Philosophy:** Leverage superior external capabilities, don't downgrade them

### Session 7 (November 19, 2025) - PHASE 1 TASKS COMPLETED ✅
- **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:** Both external advanced services now production-ready with HTTP APIs
- **Task 1.1 COMPLETE:** sutra-embedder v1.0.1 published with 4x performance HTTP server

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD

### IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Fix Internal Deployment (Shortest Path)
```bash
# Option 1: Build missing HAProxy image
./sutra build haproxy

# Option 2: Use simple edition without HAProxy  
./sutra clean --containers && SUTRA_EDITION=simple ./sutra deploy

# Option 3: Fix compose profiles to exclude HAProxy for simple edition
```

### MEDIUM-TERM SOLUTION: External Service Authentication
```bash
# Create GitHub PAT with read:packages scope
# Login to GitHub Container Registry
echo $GITHUB_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u nranjan2code --password-stdin

# Test external image access
docker pull ghcr.io/nranjan2code/sutra-embedder:v1.0.1
```

### LONG-TERM SOLUTION: Make Packages Public
- Navigate to GitHub → Repositories → Package settings
- Change visibility from Private to Public for both packages
- Enables deployment without authentication

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Current Session Priority)

### STEP 1: Monitor External Docker Image Builds 🎯 **[CURRENT PRIORITY - IN PROGRESS]**
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions build status
./monitor_github_actions.sh
```
**Current Status:** GitHub Actions still building Docker images (5-15 minutes remaining)
**External Images:** 
- ⏳ `ghcr.io/nranjan2code/sutra-embedder:v1.0.1` - Building...
- ⏳ `ghcr.io/nranjan2code/sutraworks-model:v1.0.0` - Building...

### STEP 1a: Deploy with External Services **[BLOCKED - WAITING FOR IMAGES]**
```bash
# Execute deployment once images are ready
SUTRA_EDITION=simple ./sutra deploy
```
**Expected Result:** 8 services deployed using external advanced services

### STEP 2: Validate Service Health
```bash
# Check all services are running
./sutra status

# Verify external services are responding
curl http://localhost:8888/health  # Advanced Rust embedding service
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # Enterprise AI NLG service
```
**Expected Result:** All services healthy, external APIs responding correctly

### STEP 3: Run Comprehensive Testing Suite
```bash
# Smoke tests (basic functionality)
./sutra test smoke

# Integration tests (service connectivity)  
./sutra test integration

### ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive Production Testing
```bash
# Successfully executed comprehensive validation:
./sutra status              # All services operational ✅
./validate_production.sh    # Internal connectivity validated ✅
docker ps                   # 15 containers running ✅
