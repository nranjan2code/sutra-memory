## Risks & Mitigation

- 30-day POC limit (create urgency)
- Success criteria defined pre-POC (clear goals)
- Weekly stakeholder reviews (maintain momentum)

### Risk 3: Competition from Microsoft/Neo4j
**Risk:** Large incumbents add reasoning features  
**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (sign 50 customers before they react)
- Deep vertical expertise (healthcare compliance)
- Community lock-in (open-source adoption)
- Technical moat (performance, architecture)

### Risk 4: Market Timing (Too Early?)
**Risk:** Enterprises not ready for explainable AI  
**Mitigation:**
