# Partnership & Channel Strategy
## Building Ecosystem for Sutra AI

**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Partnership Horizon:** 2025-2027 (24 months)  
**Target:** 30% of revenue through partners by end 2027  
**Owner:** VP Partnerships + Sales

---

## Executive Summary

Sutra AI's partnership strategy targets **3 partnership tiers**:

1. **System Integrators (SIs)** - Sell and implement Sutra (Accenture, Deloitte, PWC)
2. **Technology Partners** - Integrate Sutra with their platforms (Neo4j, Databricks, Snowflake)
3. **Cloud Marketplaces** - List Sutra for easy procurement (AWS, Azure, GCP)

**Revenue Impact:**
- 2026: 10% of revenue through partners ($400K)
- 2027: 30% of revenue through partners ($4.2M)
- 2028: 50% of revenue through partners ($13.5M)

**Key Insight:** Partners provide distribution we can't afford to build ourselves. SI partnerships = 10× sales force. Cloud marketplaces = simplified procurement (no RFP).

---

## Partnership Tier 1: System Integrators (SIs)

### Why System Integrators?

**Problem:** Healthcare/finance enterprises want "full service" (not just software).

**What SIs Offer:**
- Implementation services ($500K-$2M projects)
- Change management (train clinicians, compliance teams)
- Integration (EHR, core banking, existing systems)
- Ongoing support (24/7 managed services)

**What Sutra Offers:**
- Software license (30% of project value)
- Technical training (certify SI consultants)
- Joint sales (co-sell to SI's existing customers)

**Win-Win:**
- SIs: High-margin services revenue ($200/hr consulting)
- Sutra: Distribution to Fortune 500 (SI relationships)
- Customer: End-to-end solution (one throat to choke)

---

### Target System Integrators (Priority Order)

#### Tier 1: Global SIs (Target: 3 partnerships by end 2026)

**1. Accenture**
- **Relationship:** Healthcare & finance practices (10,000+ consultants)
- **Opportunity:** $2B AI services practice (Sutra could be 1% = $20M)
- **Status:** Cold (no relationship yet)
- **Action Plan:**
  - Q4 2025: Intro through investor (Accenture Ventures)
  - Q1 2026: Joint POC at shared healthcare customer
  - Q2 2026: Sign partnership agreement (revenue share: 70/30 SI/Sutra)

**Revenue Potential (2027):**
- 10 joint projects @ $1M = $10M total project value
- Sutra cut: 30% = $3M license revenue ✅

---

**2. Deloitte**

- 3 projects @ $800K = $2.4M total
- Sutra cut: 30% = $720K

---

#### Tier 2: Boutique SIs (Target: 5 partnerships by end 2026)

**Why Boutiques?**
- Faster to partner (no 12-month procurement)
- Specialized (healthcare-only, finance-only)
- Hungry for differentiation (need unique offerings)

**Criteria:**
- Revenue: $10M-$100M (not too small, not too big)
- Vertical focus (healthcare, finance, legal)
- Existing customers (warm leads for Sutra)
- Technical depth (can implement complex integrations)

**Target List:**
1. **Point B** (management consulting, healthcare)
2. **Slalom** (technology consulting, AWS partner)
3. **Cognizant** (IT services, healthcare + finance)
4. **Capgemini** (digital transformation)
5. **West Monroe** (financial services focus)

**Revenue Potential (2027):**
- 5 partners × 2 projects each @ $500K = $5M total
- Sutra cut: 30% = $1.5M

---

### SI Partnership Program Design

**Program Name:** "Sutra Certified Partner"

**Benefits for SIs:**
```
Tier 1: Authorized Partner (1 project)
- 25% software discount (pass to customer or keep margin)
- Technical training (2-day bootcamp)
- Co-marketing (joint case study)

Tier 2: Preferred Partner (5 projects)
- 30% software discount
- Dedicated Sutra SE (solutions engineer)
- Lead referrals (Sutra sends inbound leads)
- Joint sales calls

Tier 3: Strategic Partner (15+ projects)
- 35% software discount
- Dedicated partnership manager
- Product roadmap input (prioritize features)
- Revenue share (get 5% recurring revenue)
```

**Requirements:**
- Tier 1: 2 certified consultants
- Tier 2: 5 certified consultants
- Tier 3: 15 certified consultants

---

### Certification Program

**Course:** "Sutra Implementation Bootcamp" (2 days)

**Day 1: Technical**
- Architecture overview (Rust storage, Python reasoning)
- Installation (Docker Compose, Kubernetes)
- Configuration (SAML, RBAC, audit logs)
- Integration patterns (EHR, core banking)
- Troubleshooting (logs, monitoring)

**Day 2: Business**
- Use cases (healthcare, finance, legal)
- Sales messaging (competitive battlecards)
- Scoping projects (estimate effort)
- Customer success (adoption best practices)
- Demo delivery (hands-on practice)

**Certification:**
- 80% exam pass rate (technical knowledge)
- Deliver 1 practice demo (recorded, reviewed)
- Complete 1 implementation (shadow Sutra team)

**Cost:** Free for partners (Sutra investment)

**Cadence:** Quarterly (4× per year, 20 consultants per cohort)

---

### Revenue Share Model

**Option 1: Upfront Software Fee (Preferred)**
```
SI sells $1M project:
- SI services: $700K (70%)
- Sutra license: $300K (30%)

SI keeps 100% of services revenue.
Sutra keeps 100% of license revenue.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Simple (no ongoing revenue tracking)
- Aligned incentives (SI wants large projects)
- Clean financials (SI invoices customer for services, Sutra invoices for license)

---

**Option 2: Revenue Share (Alternative)**
```
SI sells $1M project (no separate license fee):
- Year 1: SI pays Sutra 10% = $100K
- Year 2: Customer renews, Sutra gets 30% = $30K
- Year 3: Customer renews, Sutra gets 30% = $30K

Why This Works:
- Lower barrier (SI doesn't need to sell "software + services")
- Recurring revenue (Sutra gets ongoing cut)
- Risk sharing (Sutra only earns if customer succeeds)

Why NOT Preferred:
- Complex accounting (track revenue splits)
- Lower upfront revenue (Sutra gets 10% vs 30%)
- Dependency on SI (they own customer relationship)
```

---

### SI Partnership Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: SI Competes (Builds Own GraphRAG)**
- **Mitigation:** Exclusive partnership clause (non-compete for 3 years)
- **Mitigation:** Faster innovation (SIs can't keep up with Sutra R&D)

**Risk 2: SI Doesn't Prioritize (Too Many Partnerships)**
- **Mitigation:** Revenue targets (5 projects per year minimum)
- **Mitigation:** Dedicated partner manager (relationship owner)

**Risk 3: Poor Implementation (SI Screws Up, Customer Blames Sutra)**
- **Mitigation:** Certification required (quality control)
- **Mitigation:** Sutra reviews architecture (approval before deployment)
- **Mitigation:** Joint support (Sutra available for escalations)

---

## Partnership Tier 2: Technology Partners

### Why Technology Partners?

**Problem:** Customers use existing tools (databases, data platforms). Sutra must integrate.

**What Tech Partners Offer:**
- Distribution (their customer base = warm leads)
- Ecosystem (listed in their marketplace)
- Co-marketing (joint webinars, case studies)
- Technical integration (connectors, APIs)

**What Sutra Offers:**
- Complementary product (reasoning layer on top of their platform)
- Customer retention (Sutra customers use their product too)
- Upsell opportunity (they sell more licenses)

**Win-Win:**
- Tech Partner: Ecosystem richness (more integrations = stickier)
- Sutra: Distribution (listed in their marketplace)
- Customer: Best-of-breed (use both products together)

---

### Target Technology Partners (Priority Order)

#### Partner 1: Neo4j (Graph Database)

**Strategic Rationale:**
> "Integrate with Neo4j, don't compete."

**Use Case:**

### Why Cloud Marketplaces?

**Benefits for Customers:**
1. **Simplified procurement** - Use existing AWS/Azure contract (no new RFP)
2. **Consolidated billing** - One invoice (not separate vendor)
3. **Cloud credits** - Apply unused credits (often $100K+ sitting idle)
4. **Faster approvals** - Security pre-vetted (marketplace requirements)

**Benefits for Sutra:**
1. **Lower friction** - Close deals faster (days vs months)
2. **Higher conversion** - 30% higher close rate (marketplace trust)
3. **Larger deals** - Customers more willing to commit (using credits)

**Trade-off:**
- Marketplace fees: 20% (high but worth it for distribution)

---

| **TOTAL** | - | - | - | **$14M** | **100%** |

**Partner Revenue:** $9.6M (69% of total) ✅  
**Direct Revenue:** $4.3M (31% of total)

**Goal:** 30% partner revenue by end 2027 → **EXCEEDED** (achieved 69%)

---

### Partner CAC vs Direct CAC

**Direct Sales CAC:**
- Marketing: $2,500
- Sales: $2,500
- **Total: $5,000** per customer

**Partner Sales CAC:**
- Partner recruitment: $500 (amortized)
- Partner training: $300 (amortized)
- Partner enablement: $200 (ongoing)
- **Total: $1,000** per customer ✅

**Savings:** $4,000 per customer (80% lower CAC)

**Why This Matters:**
- 50% of revenue through partners by 2028
- CAC drops from $5,000 to $3,000 (blended)
- LTV:CAC improves from 51:1 to 85:1 ✅

---

## Partnership Operations

### Partner Management Structure

**Roles:**
- **VP Partnerships** (hire Q2 2026) - Strategy, executive relationships
- **Partner Manager** (hire Q4 2026) - Day-to-day SI relationships
- **Alliance Manager** (hire Q1 2027) - Tech partner integrations
- **Channel Manager** (hire Q3 2027) - Reseller program

**Budget:**
- Headcount: $500K/year (4 people by end 2027)
- Partner marketing: $200K/year (co-marketing funds)
- Training/enablement: $100K/year (bootcamps, certifications)
- **Total: $800K/year**

**ROI:**
- Partner revenue: $9.6M (2027)
- Partner costs: $800K
- **ROI: 12:1** ✅

---

### Partner Relationship Management (PRM) System

**Tool:** "Partner Portal" (custom-built)

**Features:**
- Deal registration (lock in opportunities)
- Lead distribution (route inbound leads to partners)
- Co-marketing funds (request $5K for joint webinar)
- Training resources (bootcamp videos, docs)
- Performance dashboard (track partner metrics)

**Metrics Tracked:**
- # certified consultants
- # deals closed (quarterly)
- Revenue generated (partner vs direct attribution)
- Customer satisfaction (NPS for partner-led implementations)

**Timeline:** Build Q1 2026 (before partner program scales)

---

### Partner Compensation & Incentives

**Quarterly Incentives:**
```
Bronze: 3 deals closed = $5K bonus
Silver: 5 deals closed = $10K bonus
Gold: 10 deals closed = $25K bonus
```

**Annual Incentives:**
```
Partner of the Year: $50K + trip to annual conference
Fastest Growth: $25K
Best Customer NPS: $25K
```

**Why This Works:**
- Gamification (partners compete for bonuses)
- Recognition (trophy + press release)
- Alignment (behaviors we want = behaviors we reward)

---

## Partnership Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Partner Conflict (Two Partners Chase Same Deal)

**Mitigation:** Deal registration system
- First partner to register = deal owner
- 30-day protection window (can't be poached)
- Sutra adjudicates disputes (fair but firm)

---

### Risk 2: Partner Poaches Customers (Direct Sales)

**Mitigation:** Rules of engagement
- Partner leads partner-sourced deals (no Sutra involvement)
- Sutra leads Sutra-sourced deals (partner supports)
- Split if both involved (50/50 revenue share)

---

### Risk 3: Partner Quality Issues (Bad Implementations)

**Mitigation:** Quality control
- Architecture review required (Sutra approves design)
- Final testing required (Sutra signs off before go-live)
- Escalation path (customer can call Sutra directly)
- Partner de-certification (3 strikes = removed from program)

---

## Conclusion: Partnership Impact

### Success Metrics (2027 Targets)

| **Metric** | **Target** | **Impact** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| # SI partners | 5 | $5M revenue |
| # Tech partners | 5 | $4M revenue |
| # Marketplace listings | 3 | $1.8M revenue |
| Partner-sourced revenue | 70% | $9.6M of $14M |
| Partner CAC | $1,000 | 80% lower than direct |
| LTV:CAC (with partners) | 85:1 | Up from 51:1 |

**Overall Assessment:** Partners are **critical** to hitting $14M ARR in 2027. Without partners, would need to 2× sales team (expensive).

**Next Steps:**
1. Q4 2025: Launch SI partner program, recruit 3 SIs
2. Q1 2026: List in AWS Marketplace
3. Q2 2026: Sign 2 tech partnerships (Neo4j, Databricks)
4. Q3 2026: Expand to Europe (first reseller)

**Owner:** VP Partnerships (hire by end Q1 2026)  
**Review:** Quarterly partnership business review (QBR)
