**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Risk Assessment Period:** 2025-2027 (24 months)  
**Review Cadence:** Quarterly  
**Owner:** CEO + Board of Directors

---

## Executive Summary

Sutra AI faces **13 critical risks** across 5 categories. Overall risk profile: **MEDIUM** (manageable with mitigation).

**Highest Risks (Urgent):**
1. 🔴 **Market Timing Risk** - Too early, market not ready (60% probability, HIGH impact)
2. 🔴 **Competitive Response** - Microsoft/Neo4j productize fast (50% probability, HIGH impact)
3. 🟡 **Sales Execution Risk** - Long healthcare cycles (70% probability, MEDIUM impact)

**Mitigations in Place:**
- ✅ Healthcare-first strategy (regulatory mandates = pull, not push)
- ✅ 12-18 month technical lead (lock-free, MPPA, adaptive reconciliation)
- ✅ Open-source insurance (community survives if company fails)

**Capital at Risk:** $9.5M (seed + Series A)  
**Downside Scenario:** Slow adoption → extend runway → pivot to services → breakeven at $2M ARR  
**Upside Preserved:** If market accelerates, Sutra positioned to capture category

---

## Risk Category 1: Market Risks

### Risk 1.1: Market Timing - Too Early

**Description:**
GraphRAG is a new category (coined 2024). Enterprises may not understand the value or have budget allocated. "Explainable AI" may not be top priority yet.

**Probability:** 60% (HIGH)  
**Impact:** HIGH ($10M+ revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2025-2026

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Demo requests <10/month (low awareness)
- Sales cycles >12 months (education required)
- "What is GraphRAG?" questions dominate calls
- Procurement says "no budget for this category"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 1.1.1: Regulatory Tailwinds (FDA, Fair Lending)**
> Focus on verticals WHERE explainability is mandatory, not optional.

**Actions:**
- Target FDA-regulated medical devices (explainability required for 510(k))
- Target banks under OCC fair lending oversight (must explain credit denials)
- Target public companies (SOX compliance requires audit trails)

**Why This Works:**
- Regulatory mandate = budget exists
- Compliance deadline = urgency
- Legal risk = executive sponsorship

**Timeline:** Already implemented (healthcare-first GTM)

---

**Mitigation 1.1.2: Education & Thought Leadership**
> Create the category. Teach the market what GraphRAG is.

**Actions:**
- Publish "What is GraphRAG?" whitepaper (10K downloads target)
- Conference talks (AI Summit, HIMSS, Sibos) - 10+ per year
- Analyst briefings (Gartner, Forrester) - get on their radar
- Free webinars (50+ per year, 1K total attendees)

**Why This Works:**
- Sutra defines the category (own "GraphRAG")
- Educate buyers → they search for Sutra
- Analyst recognition → enterprises trust us

**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q4 2026 (12 months of education)

---

**Mitigation 1.1.3: Backup Revenue: Professional Services**
> If product sales slow, pivot to consulting revenue (keep cash flow positive).

**Actions:**
- Offer "GraphRAG implementation" services ($100K/project)
- Partner with system integrators (Accenture, Deloitte) - they sell, we deliver
- Training programs ($10K per day) - certify customer engineers

**Why This Works:**
- Services revenue faster to close (no long sales cycles)
- Builds case studies (future product sales)
- Positive cash flow (buy time for market to mature)

**Timeline:** Launch Q2 2026 if product sales <$1M ARR by Q1 2026

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 60% → 40% (still possible, but mitigated)
- Impact: HIGH → MEDIUM (services revenue backstop)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

### Risk 1.2: Market Saturation - Too Late

**Description:**
Microsoft or Neo4j productize GraphRAG before Sutra gains traction. Market adopts their solution. Sutra becomes "also-ran."

**Probability:** 30% (MEDIUM)  
**Impact:** CATASTROPHIC (company fails)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026-2027

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Microsoft announces "Azure GraphRAG Service" (managed offering)
- Neo4j GraphRAG hits GA (general availability) with enterprise features
- Customers say "We'll wait for Microsoft/Neo4j"
- Press covers Microsoft/Neo4j, not Sutra

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 1.2.1: First-Mover Advantage - Land 100 Customers Fast**
> Win customers before competitors productize. Switching costs = moat.

**Actions:**
- Aggressive pricing (discount first 50 customers by 50%)
- Fast implementation (deploy in 1 week vs 3 months)
- Lock-in through data gravity (integrated knowledge graphs are sticky)

**Why This Works:**
- Switching costs (re-implementation = 6-12 months)
- Network effects (Sutra community grows)
- Customer references (enterprises trust "who else uses this")

**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q4 2026 (12 months to land 100 customers)

---

**Mitigation 1.2.2: Technical Moat - Stay 12 Months Ahead**
> Continuously ship features competitors don't have.

**Actions:**
- Adaptive reconciliation (80% CPU savings) - they don't have this
- MPPA algorithm (multi-path consensus) - they don't have this
- Production durability (WAL, 2PC) - they don't have this

**Roadmap:**
- Q4 2025: Real-time streaming (event-driven reasoning)
- Q2 2026: Federated learning (privacy-preserving graphs)
- Q4 2026: Multimodal graphs (images, videos, not just text)

**Why This Works:**
- Technical complexity = 12-18 month replication time
- Patents pending (adaptive reconciliation)
- First-mover learning (production experience)

**Timeline:** Already ahead; maintain lead through 2027

---

**Mitigation 1.2.3: Open-Source Moat - Community Velocity**
> Microsoft/Neo4j are proprietary. Sutra's community contributes features faster.

**Actions:**
- 500+ GitHub stars by end 2025
- 10+ external contributors (not just Sutra employees)
- Monthly releases (vs Neo4j quarterly releases)

**Why This Works:**
- Community contributions = faster feature velocity
- Open code = trust (enterprises prefer auditability)
- Network effects (more users = more contributions)

**Timeline:** Already open-source; grow community 2025-2026

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 30% → 20% (still possible if Microsoft moves fast)
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC → HIGH (community survives if company pivots)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable but watch closely)

---

### Risk 1.3: Economic Downturn

**Description:**
Recession hits. Enterprises freeze budgets. "Nice to have" projects (like AI explainability) get cut.

**Probability:** 40% (MEDIUM) - Global recession indicators present  
**Impact:** HIGH ($5M+ revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2025-2027 (unpredictable)

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Budget cuts at customer meetings
- Sales cycles extend to 18+ months
- "Pause until next fiscal year" objections
- Layoffs at target customers (no hiring freeze exceptions)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 1.3.1: Position as Cost Saver, Not Cost Center**
> Explainability avoids regulatory fines (saves money).

**Messaging:**
- "Avoid $10M FDA penalty" (not "improve AI")
- "Reduce malpractice suits by $500K/year" (not "better diagnosis")
- "Prevent $5M fair lending fine" (not "explainable credit")

**Why This Works:**
- Cost avoidance = defensive budget (harder to cut)
- ROI <12 months (pays for itself)
- Risk mitigation = CFO approves (not just CTO)

**Timeline:** Update messaging Q4 2025 (proactive, not reactive)

---

**Mitigation 1.3.2: Lower-Priced Tiers**
> If enterprises freeze, target mid-market ($2.5K/month vs $10K).

**Actions:**
- Promote Professional tier (vs Enterprise)
- Volume discounts (pay annually, save 20%)
- Freemium to paid conversion (Community → Professional)

**Why This Works:**
- Mid-market less affected by downturns
- Smaller contracts = faster approvals (no board review)
- Self-serve motion (no sales team required)

**Timeline:** Already in place; emphasize if downturn hits

---

**Mitigation 1.3.3: Extend Runway - Cut Burn**
> Reduce OpEx if revenue drops.

**Actions:**
- Hiring freeze (delay 5 sales hires)
- Marketing cuts (reduce paid ads by 50%)
- Remote-first (no office lease)
- Executive pay cuts (20% if needed)

**Worst Case:**
- Burn: $3M/year → $1.5M/year (50% reduction)
- Runway: 18 months → 36 months
- Revenue target: $4M ARR → $2M ARR (still profitable)

**Timeline:** Activate if Q1 2026 revenue <$500K

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 40% (unchanged - macro risk)
- Impact: HIGH → MEDIUM (runway extended)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

## Risk Category 2: Competitive Risks

### Risk 2.1: Microsoft Productizes GraphRAG

**Description:**
Microsoft turns their research code into "Azure GraphRAG" (managed service). Bundles with Azure AI. Enterprises choose Microsoft for "one vendor" simplicity.

**Probability:** 50% (HIGH) - They have the resources  
**Impact:** HIGH ($10M+ revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026-2027 (12-18 months to productize)

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Microsoft job postings (GraphRAG product manager)
- Azure blog posts about GraphRAG
- Microsoft at GraphRAG conferences
- Customer calls mention "waiting for Microsoft"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 2.1.1: Head Start - Land Customers Before Microsoft GA**
> Win 100 customers before Microsoft launches. Switching costs = retention.

**Actions:**
- Aggressive GTM (10 AEs by end 2026)
- First 50 customers: 50% discount (lock them in)
- Multi-year contracts (3-year deals, prepaid)

**Why This Works:**
- Switching costs (re-implementation = 6-12 months, $500K)
- Data gravity (knowledge graph is proprietary)
- Contracts lock customers through 2028

**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q4 2026 (before Microsoft launches)

---

**Mitigation 2.1.2: Differentiation - What Microsoft Won't Have**
> Focus on features Microsoft can't/won't build.

**Sutra Advantages:**
1. **On-Premise Deployment** - Microsoft is cloud-only
   - Target: Healthcare (HIPAA air-gapped)
   - Target: Finance (data sovereignty)
   - Target: Government (FedRAMP but still on-prem preferred)

2. **Open-Source Auditability** - Microsoft is proprietary
   - Target: Security-conscious (audit code)
   - Target: Customization (modify source)

3. **No Vendor Lock-In** - Microsoft locks to Azure
   - Target: Multi-cloud (AWS, GCP customers)

**Timeline:** Already differentiated; emphasize in sales

---

**Mitigation 2.1.3: Partner with Microsoft**
> If you can't beat them, join them.

**Actions:**
- List Sutra on Azure Marketplace (they take 20%, we get distribution)
- "Powered by Sutra" OEM deal (Microsoft private-labels our tech)
- Co-sell motion (joint sales calls)

**Why This Works:**
- Azure Marketplace = 10M+ potential customers
- Microsoft sales force = 1,000+ enterprise AEs
- Credibility ("Microsoft partner" badge)

**Timeline:** Initiate discussions Q2 2026

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 50% (unchanged - they will productize)
- Impact: HIGH → MEDIUM (partnership converts threat to opportunity)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

### Risk 2.2: Neo4j Catches Up

**Description:**
Neo4j invests heavily in GraphRAG feature. Leverages existing customer base (1,000+ enterprises). Bundles GraphRAG with database (free add-on).

**Probability:** 40% (MEDIUM) - They have the distribution  
**Impact:** MEDIUM ($5M revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026-2027

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Neo4j hires AI/ML team (LinkedIn postings)
- GraphRAG feature exits beta (GA announcement)
- Neo4j at AI conferences (not just database events)
- Customers ask "Why not just use Neo4j?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 2.2.1: Target Non-Neo4j Customers**
> Focus on greenfield opportunities (no existing Neo4j installation).

**Actions:**
- Target healthcare (Neo4j weak in this vertical)
- Target mid-market (Neo4j focuses on enterprise)
- Target cloud-native (Neo4j on-prem legacy)

**Why This Works:**
- No switching costs (fresh start)
- No incumbent relationship (neutral evaluation)
- Faster sales cycle (no "wait for Neo4j upgrade")

**Timeline:** Already in place (healthcare-first GTM)

---

**Mitigation 2.2.2: Integrate with Neo4j**
> If customer has Neo4j, Sutra sits on top (reasoning layer).

**Actions:**
- Build Neo4j connector (Sutra reads from Neo4j graph)
- "Best of both worlds" messaging (Neo4j stores, Sutra reasons)
- Joint case study (Sutra + Neo4j customer)

**Why This Works:**
- No rip-and-replace (customers keep Neo4j investment)
- Upsell opportunity (add Sutra for reasoning)
- Neo4j customers are warm leads (already use graphs)

**Timeline:** Build connector Q1 2026

---

**Mitigation 2.2.3: Price Aggressively**
> Neo4j Enterprise = $150K/year. Sutra Professional = $30K/year (5× cheaper).

**Actions:**
- "Why pay $150K for a database when Sutra is $30K for reasoning?"
- TCO calculator (show 70% savings)
- Head-to-head demos (performance + price)

**Why This Works:**
- Budget-constrained customers choose Sutra
- Mid-market can't afford Neo4j (Sutra is accessible)
- Price-sensitive verticals (healthcare, non-profit)

**Timeline:** Already priced aggressively; emphasize in sales

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 40% (unchanged - they will invest)
- Impact: MEDIUM → LOW (integration converts competitor to partner)
- **Final Risk:** 🟢 LOW (manageable)

---

### Risk 2.3: Unexpected Competitor

**Description:**
Startup (stealth mode) or open-source project (GitHub) launches competing GraphRAG system. Faster, cheaper, or better features.

**Probability:** 20% (LOW) - Rare but possible  
**Impact:** MEDIUM ($3M revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026-2027

**Early Warning Signs:**
- New GitHub repos (graphrag-plus, hypergraph-ai)
- Hacker News frontpage (YC-funded GraphRAG startup)
- Conference talks by unknown companies
- Customers mention "we're evaluating X"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 2.3.1: Continuous Innovation**
> Stay ahead with features competitors can't replicate quickly.

**Actions:**
- Patents filed (adaptive reconciliation, MPPA)
- Trade secrets (implementation details not public)
- 12-month feature lead (production hardening takes time)

**Timeline:** Already ahead; maintain through R&D investment

---

**Mitigation 2.3.2: Acquisition**
> If competitor gains traction, acquire them (acqui-hire).

**Actions:**
- Monitor GitHub stars (sudden spikes)
- Attend conferences (meet founders)
- Offer to acquire (before they raise Series A)

**Budget:** $1-3M (seed-stage acquisition)

**Why This Works:**
- Eliminate competitor (consolidate market)
- Acquire talent (founders join Sutra)
- Acquire IP (patents, code)

**Timeline:** Opportunistic (if threat emerges)

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 20% (unchanged - hard to predict)
- Impact: MEDIUM → LOW (acquisition option)
- **Final Risk:** 🟢 LOW (watch but not urgent)

---

## Risk Category 3: Execution Risks

### Risk 3.1: Sales Execution - Long Cycles

**Description:**
Healthcare sales cycles = 12-18 months. Miss revenue targets. Burn through capital before reaching profitability.

**Probability:** 70% (HIGH) - Healthcare is slow  
**Impact:** MEDIUM ($3M revenue miss)  
**Time Horizon:** 2025-2027

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Average sales cycle >12 months (vs 6-month target)
- Win rate <30% (vs 50% target)
- Pipeline stalls (no progress for 3+ months)
- Q1 2026 revenue <$500K (off track for $4M ARR)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 3.1.1: Add Faster Verticals**
> If healthcare is slow, add finance (6-9 month cycles).

**Actions:**
- Launch finance vertical Q2 2026 (parallel to healthcare)
- Hire AE with banking experience
- Build finance case studies (2-3 by end 2026)

**Why This Works:**
- Diversified revenue (not dependent on healthcare)
- Faster cash flow (9 months vs 18 months)
- Cross-sell opportunity (healthcare + finance customers)

**Timeline:** Q2 2026 (if Q1 2026 healthcare pipeline weak)

---

**Mitigation 3.1.2: Product-Led Growth**
> Self-serve motion for smaller deals (no sales cycle).

**Actions:**
- Free Community Edition (land accounts)
- Credit card sign-up for Professional tier ($2.5K/month = no procurement)
- Usage-based pricing (customers start small, expand)

**Why This Works:**
- No sales cycle (instant signup)
- Lower CAC ($500 vs $5,000)
- Faster time-to-revenue (days vs months)

**Timeline:** Launch Q2 2027 (cloud product)

---

**Mitigation 3.1.3: Extend Runway**
> If sales slow, reduce burn to stretch capital.

**Actions:**
- Delay hiring (5 AEs → 2 AEs)
- Cut marketing (50% reduction)
- Founder sales (CEO closes deals, no AE overhead)

**Result:**
- Burn: $3M/year → $1.5M/year
- Runway: 18 months → 36 months

**Timeline:** Activate if Q1 2026 revenue <$500K

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 70% → 50% (still likely, but diversified)
- Impact: MEDIUM → LOW (runway extended)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

### Risk 3.2: Product Gaps - Missing Features

**Description:**
Customers require features Sutra doesn't have (e.g., SAML SSO, role-based access control). Deals stall. Lose to Neo4j.

**Probability:** 50% (MEDIUM) - Enterprise checklist is long  
**Impact:** MEDIUM ($2M revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- "We need SAML" objection (security requirement)
- "No RBAC" red flag (compliance requirement)
- "Missing audit logs" concern (regulatory requirement)
- POCs fail (feature gaps prevent production use)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 3.2.1: Enterprise Feature Roadmap**
> Build enterprise checklist features Q4 2025 - Q2 2026.

**Priority 1 (Q4 2025):**
- SAML SSO (Okta, Azure AD integration)
- RBAC (role-based access control)
- Audit logs (immutable, exportable)

**Priority 2 (Q1 2026):**
- Data encryption at rest (HIPAA requirement)
- SOC 2 Type II certification (enterprise procurement)
- High availability (multi-node clustering)

**Priority 3 (Q2 2026):**
- Disaster recovery (automated backups)
- Multi-tenancy (SaaS requirement)
- Usage analytics (customer success)

**Timeline:** 9-month sprint (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026)

---

**Mitigation 3.2.2: Partner for Gaps**
> If we can't build fast enough, integrate with partners.

**Examples:**
- Auth: Integrate Auth0 (vs building SAML)
- Monitoring: Integrate Datadog (vs building dashboard)
- Backup: Integrate Veeam (vs building DR)

**Why This Works:**
- Faster time-to-market (weeks vs months)
- "Best of breed" (customers prefer specialized tools)
- Lower engineering cost (integration vs full build)

**Timeline:** Evaluate each gap (build vs integrate decision)

---

**Mitigation 3.2.3: Prioritize by Revenue**
> Build features that unblock the largest deals.

**Process:**
1. List all customer feature requests
2. Sum ARR blocked by each feature
3. Build top 5 by ARR (not by number of requests)

**Example:**
- SAML blocks 10 deals @ $100K = $1M ARR → BUILD
- Dark mode blocks 50 deals @ $10K = $500K ARR → DELAY

**Timeline:** Already in place (product prioritization process)

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 50% → 30% (roadmap addresses gaps)
- Impact: MEDIUM → LOW (unblocks deals)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

### Risk 3.3: Team Execution - Key Person Risk

**Description:**
Founder/CTO leaves, gets hit by a bus, or burns out. Engineering velocity drops. Product stalls.

**Probability:** 10% (LOW) - Unlikely but catastrophic if happens  
**Impact:** CATASTROPHIC (company fails without founder)  
**Time Horizon:** 2025-2027

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Founder health issues
- Founder-investor conflict
- Founder burnout signals (missed meetings, disengagement)
- Key engineer departures (domino effect)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 3.3.1: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer**
> Reduce bus factor (knowledge shouldn't live in one person's head).

**Actions:**
- Architecture docs (Rust storage, reasoning engine)
- Code reviews (2+ engineers understand each module)
- Recorded demos (video library for customer calls)
- Succession plan (written, board-approved)

**Timeline:** Complete by end 2025

---

**Mitigation 3.3.2: Hire #2 Engineering Lead**
> Redundancy in technical leadership.

**Actions:**
- Hire Staff/Principal Engineer (Q2 2026)
- Cross-train on Rust storage (not just founder)
- Empower to make architectural decisions (not bottleneck)

**Why This Works:**
- Bus factor = 2 (not 1)
- Founder can focus on strategy (not every PR review)
- Retention (engineers want growth path)

**Timeline:** Hire by end Q2 2026

---

**Mitigation 3.3.3: Insurance**
> Key person life insurance (covers runway if founder dies).

**Actions:**
- $5M policy on founder (covers 24 months runway)
- Disability insurance (covers health issues)
- Vesting acceleration (equity vests if founder passes)

**Cost:** $10K-$20K/year (worth it)

**Timeline:** Purchase by end 2025

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 10% (unchanged - life is unpredictable)
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC → HIGH (insurance + succession plan)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (low probability but mitigated)

---

## Risk Category 4: Financial Risks

### Risk 4.1: Fundraising Failure

**Description:**
Series A fails to close (weak traction, market downturn, investor skepticism). Run out of capital. Forced to shut down or sell at distress price.

**Probability:** 30% (MEDIUM) - Seed-to-A failure rate ~50%  
**Impact:** CATASTROPHIC (company fails)  
**Time Horizon:** Q2 2026 (Series A planned)

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- <$2M ARR by Q1 2026 (below investor expectations)
- Investor meetings go poorly (no follow-ups)
- Term sheet negotiations stall (valuation gap)
- Market downturn (VC dry up)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 4.1.1: Path to Profitability (No Series A Needed)**
> Bootstrap to profitability on seed capital.

**Actions:**
- Reduce burn: $3M/year → $1.5M/year
- Extend runway: 18 months → 36 months
- Hit breakeven: $2M ARR (achievable without Series A)

**Why This Works:**
- Profitability = optionality (raise when you want, not need)
- Stronger negotiation (take best deal, not only deal)
- Survive downturn (no dependency on VC market)

**Timeline:** Activate if Q1 2026 ARR <$1M (weak Series A position)

---

**Mitigation 4.1.2: Alternative Funding Sources**
> If VC fails, raise from corporates or debt.

**Options:**
1. **Venture Debt** - $2M at 10% interest (non-dilutive)
2. **Corporate VC** - Microsoft M12, Databricks, Snowflake (strategic)
3. **Grants** - NIH SBIR ($1M for healthcare AI)
4. **Revenue-Based Financing** - Pipe, Clearco (repay from revenue)

**Why This Works:**
- Multiple funding paths (not dependent on one VC)
- Non-dilutive options preserve founder equity
- Strategic investors = distribution partnerships

**Timeline:** Explore Q4 2025 (before Series A needed)

---

**Mitigation 4.1.3: Acquisition Offer**
> If can't raise, sell to strategic acquirer.

**Potential Acquirers:**
- Neo4j (eliminate competitor, $20M-$50M)
- Databricks (add reasoning to Lakehouse, $50M-$100M)
- Microsoft (productize research, $30M-$80M)

**Minimum Acceptable:** $20M (2.5× Series A valuation)

**Why This Works:**
- Exit for investors (2-3× return on seed)
- Outcome for founders ($5M+ personal)
- Preserve technology (lives on inside acquirer)

**Timeline:** Last resort (only if fundraising fails)

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 30% (unchanged - macro risk)
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC → MEDIUM (alternative funding + acquisition)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

### Risk 4.2: Pricing Too Low

**Description:**
$30K Professional tier is underpriced. Customers would pay $50K-$75K. Leave money on table. Miss revenue targets despite hitting customer count.

**Probability:** 40% (MEDIUM) - Common startup mistake  
**Impact:** LOW ($1M-$2M revenue miss)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026-2027

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Customers don't negotiate (accept first price)
- No "too expensive" objections (price not a concern)
- Customers ask for more (upsell signals)
- Competitors price higher (Neo4j $150K)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 4.2.1: Price Testing**
> A/B test pricing with new customers.

**Test Plan:**
- Control group: $30K Professional
- Test group: $45K Professional (50% increase)
- Measure: Close rate, sales cycle length

**Hypothesis:** Close rate >70% at $45K → permanent increase

**Timeline:** Q1 2026 (after 20 customers at $30K baseline)

---

**Mitigation 4.2.2: Value-Based Pricing**
> Price based on value delivered, not cost to provide.

**Current:** $30K (arbitrary)

**Value-Based:**
- Avoid 1 malpractice suit = $500K saved
- Pricing should be 10-20% of value = $50K-$100K ✅

**Repositioning:**
- Don't say "$30K per year"
- Say "$2,500 per month to avoid $500K risk" (emphasis on ROI)

**Timeline:** Update messaging Q4 2025

---

**Mitigation 4.2.3: Annual Price Increases**
> Raise prices 10-15% annually (inflation + value adds).

**Plan:**
- 2026: $30K (launch)
- 2027: $35K (17% increase)
- 2028: $40K (14% increase)
- 2029: $45K (12.5% increase)

**Grandfather:** Existing customers keep old pricing for 1 year (grace period)

**Why This Works:**
- Market expects annual increases
- Tied to value delivery (new features)
- Preserves customer goodwill (grandfathering)

**Timeline:** First increase Q1 2027

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 40% (unchanged - testing will reveal)
- Impact: LOW (upside risk, not downside)
- **Final Risk:** 🟢 LOW (upside opportunity)

---

### Risk 4.3: High Churn

**Description:**
Customers cancel after 1 year (not seeing value). Churn >10% annually. Revenue retention <100%. Growth stalls.

**Probability:** 30% (MEDIUM) - SaaS average churn ~10%  
**Impact:** MEDIUM ($2M revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2027-2028 (after first renewals)

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Churn rate >10% (vs 5% target)
- Net Revenue Retention <100% (vs 120% target)
- Customers not using product (low DAU/MAU)
- "Not getting value" exit interviews

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 4.3.1: Customer Success Team**
> Proactive engagement to ensure value realization.

**Actions:**
- Hire 2 CSMs (customer success managers) by Q2 2026
- Quarterly business reviews (QBRs) - show ROI
- Health scoring (usage metrics predict churn)
- Proactive outreach (low usage = intervention)

**Why This Works:**
- Catch churn early (3 months before renewal)
- Demonstrate value (ROI reports)
- Expand use cases (land-and-expand)

**Timeline:** Hire CSMs by end Q1 2026

---

**Mitigation 4.3.2: Product Stickiness**
> Make product essential (hard to rip out).

**Actions:**
- Deep integrations (EHR, core banking) - 6+ months to replace
- Data gravity (knowledge graph is proprietary) - can't export easily
- Workflow dependency (clinicians rely on recommendations) - daily use

**Why This Works:**
- Switching costs (6-12 months to re-implement)
- Organizational dependency (users resist change)
- Sunk cost (invested in knowledge graph)

**Timeline:** Already sticky; deepen integrations 2026

---

**Mitigation 4.3.3: Multi-Year Contracts**
> Lock customers in with 2-3 year deals (upfront or annual).

**Incentives:**
- 2-year contract: 10% discount
- 3-year contract: 20% discount
- Prepay: Additional 10% off

**Why This Works:**
- Predictable revenue (reduce churn risk)
- Cash flow (prepayment helps runway)
- Retention (harder to cancel mid-contract)

**Timeline:** Offer to all new customers (Q4 2025+)

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 30% → 15% (CSMs catch churn early)
- Impact: MEDIUM → LOW (multi-year contracts lock revenue)
- **Final Risk:** 🟢 LOW (manageable)

## Risk Category 5: Operational Risks

### Risk 5.1: Security Breach

**Description:**
Hackers compromise Sutra (customer data exposed). Regulatory fines (HIPAA $50K per violation). Reputation damage. Customers churn.

**Probability:** 20% (LOW) - Cybersecurity is hard  
**Impact:** CATASTROPHIC ($10M+ fines + reputation loss)  
**Time Horizon:** 2025-2027

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Suspicious login attempts (brute force)
- Vulnerability reports (GitHub, security researchers)
- Phishing attacks (social engineering)
- Industry breach (competitors hacked → we're next)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 5.1.1: Security Hardening**
> Implement best practices before breach happens.

**Actions:**
- Penetration testing (annual, third-party)
- Bug bounty program (HackerOne, $500-$10K rewards)
- Security audits (code review by security firm)
- SOC 2 Type II certification (proves security controls)

**Cost:** $50K-$100K/year (insurance)

**Timeline:** Complete by Q2 2026 (before large customers)

---

**Mitigation 5.1.2: Incident Response Plan**
> Pre-plan response (don't improvise during breach).

**Plan:**
1. Detection (anomaly detection, alerts)
2. Containment (isolate compromised systems)
3. Eradication (remove attacker access)
4. Recovery (restore from backups)
5. Communication (notify customers within 24 hours)

**Test:** Quarterly drills (tabletop exercises)

**Timeline:** Document plan by end 2025

---

**Mitigation 5.1.3: Cyber Insurance**
> Transfer risk (insurance covers fines + legal costs).

**Coverage:**
- $5M policy (covers HIPAA fines, legal)
- Incident response team (insurer provides experts)
- Public relations (crisis management)

**Cost:** $20K-$50K/year

**Timeline:** Purchase by Q2 2026 (before healthcare customers)

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 20% → 10% (hardening reduces risk)
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC → HIGH (insurance limits damage)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (low probability but watch)

---

### Risk 5.2: Regulatory Non-Compliance

**Description:**
Sutra fails HIPAA audit. FDA rejects customer's device (cites Sutra explainability). Customers can't use Sutra in production. Revenue collapses.

**Probability:** 30% (MEDIUM) - Regulations are complex  
**Impact:** HIGH ($5M+ revenue at risk)  
**Time Horizon:** 2026-2027 (when customers go live)

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Customer audit findings (Sutra flagged)
- FDA questions in customer 510(k) submission
- HIPAA penalties (customer fined, blames Sutra)
- Procurement rejects (compliance requirement not met)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 5.2.1: Compliance Certifications**
> Get certified before customers deploy.

**Certifications:**
- **HIPAA Compliance** (BAA, encryption, audit logs) - Q1 2026
- **SOC 2 Type II** (security, availability, confidentiality) - Q2 2026
- **ISO 27001** (information security) - Q4 2026 (optional)

**Cost:** $50K-$100K (audit fees)

**Timeline:** HIPAA by Q1 2026 (healthcare launch)

---

**Mitigation 5.2.2: FDA Collaboration**
> Work with FDA to define "explainability" standards.

**Actions:**
- Pre-submission meeting (discuss what FDA needs)
- 510(k) dry run (submit mock application, get feedback)
- Publish FDA guidelines (share with customers)

**Why This Works:**
- Proactive (not reactive)
- Clarity (know expectations upfront)
- Thought leadership (Sutra defines standard)

**Timeline:** Initiate Q4 2025

---

**Mitigation 5.2.3: Legal Review**
> Hire healthcare lawyer to audit compliance.

**Scope:**
- Review Terms of Service (liability clauses)
- Review BAA (Business Associate Agreement)
- Review data handling (encryption, retention, deletion)
- Review audit logs (meet HIPAA requirements)

**Cost:** $25K-$50K (one-time)

**Timeline:** Complete by end 2025

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 30% → 15% (certifications reduce risk)
- Impact: HIGH → MEDIUM (compliance proven)
- **Final Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable)

---

### Risk 5.3: Infrastructure Failure

**Description:**
AWS outage, disk failure, or network partition. Sutra goes down. Customers can't access. SLA breach. Churn.

**Probability:** 40% (MEDIUM) - Outages happen  
**Impact:** LOW (hours of downtime, not data loss)  
**Time Horizon:** 2025-2027

**Indicators This is Happening:**
- Monitoring alerts (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Customer complaints (support tickets)
- Status page (downtime reported)
- AWS status (region outage)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Mitigation 5.3.1: High Availability**
> Multi-node clustering (no single point of failure).

**Architecture:**
- 3-node cluster (quorum for writes)
- Load balancer (distribute reads)
- Automatic failover (<30 seconds)

**Why This Works:**
- 1 node fails → 2 nodes still serve traffic
- 99.99% uptime (vs 99.9% single-node)

**Timeline:** Implement by Q2 2026 (enterprise requirement)

---

**Mitigation 5.3.2: Multi-Region Deployment**
> Geographic redundancy (AWS us-east-1 fails → failover to us-west-2).

**Setup:**
- Primary region (us-east-1)
- Backup region (us-west-2)
- Cross-region replication (asynchronous)

**Why This Works:**
- AWS region outage = rare but catastrophic
- Customers demand multi-region (Fortune 500)

**Timeline:** Implement by Q4 2026 (for largest customers)

---

**Mitigation 5.3.3: Monitoring & Alerting**
> Detect failures before customers notice.

**Tools:**
- Prometheus (metrics)
- Grafana (dashboards)
- PagerDuty (on-call rotation)

**Alerts:**
- Latency >100ms (investigate)
- Error rate >1% (page on-call)
- Disk >80% full (add capacity)

**Timeline:** Already in place; tune thresholds 2025

---

**Risk Score After Mitigation:**
- Probability: 40% → 10% (HA reduces outages)
- Impact: LOW (unchanged, downtime brief)
- **Final Risk:** 🟢 LOW (manageable)
