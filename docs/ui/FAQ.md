# Sutra AI - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Quick answers to common questions about Sutra AI**

---

## General

### What is Sutra AI?

Sutra AI is an **explainable AI system** designed for regulated industries (medical, legal, financial). Unlike general chatbots, it:

- Starts empty and learns from YOUR proprietary data
- Shows complete reasoning paths for every answer
- Provides confidence scores and "I don't know" responses
- Stores everything in knowledge graphs with full audit trails

### How is Sutra AI different from ChatGPT/Claude?

---

## Conversations

### How do I start a new conversation?

**Method 1**: Click **"+ New Chat"** in sidebar  
**Method 2**: Press **`Cmd+N`** (Mac) or **`Ctrl+N`** (Windows/Linux)

### Why doesn't the AI answer my question?

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Confidence too low**: AI says "I don't know" instead of guessing
   - **Solution**: Provide more context or rephrase

2. **No relevant knowledge**: Knowledge base doesn't contain the information
   - **Solution**: Import relevant documents

3. **Out of scope**: Question outside the domain
   - **Solution**: Check you're in the correct space

4. **Ambiguous question**: Question too vague
   - **Solution**: Be more specific

### What does the confidence score mean?

- **🟢 High (>80%)**: Very confident, strong evidence
- **🟡 Medium (50-80%)**: Moderate confidence, some uncertainty
- **🔴 Low (<50%)**: Uncertain, may respond "I don't know"

**Note**: Low confidence is a feature, not a bug. It prevents hallucinations.

### Can I edit messages after sending?

**Not currently**:
- Messages are immutable (for audit trails)
- Start a new message to clarify or correct

**Workaround**: Create a new conversation for clean slate

### How do I delete a conversation?

1. Hover over conversation in sidebar
2. Click **trash icon**
3. Confirm deletion

**Note**: Deletion is soft (recoverable by admins for audit compliance)

### Where are conversations stored?

- **User conversations**: `data/user-storage/storage.dat`
- **Domain knowledge**: `data/storage/storage.dat` (separate)
- **Encrypted**: In production mode with `SUTRA_SECURE_MODE=true`

---

## Spaces

### What is a space?

A space is an organizational unit for grouping conversations:
- Like folders for conversations
- Can have different team members
- Can use different knowledge bases
- Helps organize by project/topic/client

### Do I need to create spaces?

**No**, you get a **Personal Space** automatically:
- Private workspace just for you
- Good for personal projects
- Can create additional spaces anytime

### How many spaces can I create?

**Unlimited** (within system resources)

### Who can see my conversations in a space?

**Depends on space type:**

- **Personal Space**: Only you
- **Shared Space**: All members with appropriate roles
  - **Admin**: Full access
  - **Writer**: Read/write
  - **Reader**: Read-only

### Can I move conversations between spaces?

**Not currently** (coming soon)

**Workaround**: Copy important messages to new conversation in target space

### What happens if I delete a space?

- **Soft delete**: Space marked as deleted but data preserved
- **Conversations**: Remain in database (for audit)
- **Access**: No longer visible to users
- **Recovery**: Admin can restore if needed

---

## Search

### How does search work?

**Semantic search** using the storage engine:
- Understands meaning, not just keywords
- Example: "legal precedent" finds "case law"
- Searches conversations, messages, and spaces

### How do I search?

**Keyboard**: **`Cmd+K`** (Mac) or **`Ctrl+K`** (Windows/Linux)  
**Mouse**: Click search icon in top bar

### Why doesn't search find what I'm looking for?

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Access denied**: You don't have read access to that space
2. **Not indexed yet**: Very recent content (wait 30 seconds)
3. **Typo**: Check spelling
4. **Too vague**: Be more specific

**Tips for better search:**
- Use natural language: "How do I approve a 510(k)?"
- Be specific: "FDA approval" not just "approval"
- Try synonyms: "precedent" or "case law"

### Can I search only conversations or only messages?

**Yes**, in the command palette:
- Search shows all results by default
- Results grouped by type (Conversations, Messages, Spaces)
- API supports type-specific search (for custom integrations)

### How fast is search?

- **P99 latency**: <60ms (including semantic search)
- **Debounce**: 200-300ms (prevents API spam)
- **Perceived latency**: <500ms total

## Knowledge Graphs

### What is a reasoning graph?

A visual representation showing:
- What concepts were used
- How they're related
- Steps in the reasoning process
- Why the answer was reached

### How do I view the reasoning graph?

1. Look for **"Show reasoning"** below any AI message
2. Click to expand
3. View:
   - Reasoning steps (numbered list)
   - Knowledge graph (interactive visualization)
   - Confidence score

### What do the colors mean?

**Node colors:**
- 🟢 **Green**: High confidence (>80%)
- 🟡 **Orange**: Medium confidence (50-80%)
- 🔴 **Red**: Low confidence (<50%)

**Edge styles:**
- **Solid arrows**: Direct relationships
- **Animated**: Active reasoning path
- **Dashed**: Weak or inferred connections

### Why is the graph useful?

1. **Transparency**: See exactly how answer was reached
2. **Trust**: Verify reasoning logic
3. **Compliance**: Required for regulated industries
4. **Learning**: Understand domain relationships
5. **Debugging**: Find gaps in knowledge

### Can I export the graph?

**Currently**: Screenshot only (browser)

**Coming soon**: PNG/SVG export, PDF reports

### The graph is too large and slow. What do I do?

**Solutions:**
1. **Zoom controls**: Use minimap to navigate
2. **Node limit**: We limit to 50 nodes (most relevant)
3. **Collapse branches**: Click nodes to collapse subtrees
4. **Better hardware**: More RAM helps with large graphs

---

## Performance

### Why is the UI slow?

**Possible causes:**

1. **Slow network**: Check connection to server
2. **Large conversation**: 100+ messages
3. **Complex graph**: 50+ nodes
4. **Browser**: Try Chrome/Edge (best performance)
5. **Server resources**: Check Docker memory limits

**Solutions:**
- Use Chrome or Edge
- Close other tabs
- Increase Docker memory: `docker-compose.yml` → `mem_limit: 4g`
- Enable production mode optimizations

### How can I make search faster?

Search is already optimized (<60ms p99), but:
- Use specific queries (fewer results to rank)
- Limit scope to specific space
- Upgrade server hardware (SSD, more RAM)

### Does Sutra AI work offline?

**No**, requires connection to server:
- Server runs AI models
- Knowledge stored on server
- Can deploy server locally on laptop for "offline" use

### What's the maximum conversation length?

**No hard limit**, but:
- Context window: Last 10 messages by default
- Performance: 100+ messages may slow rendering
- Best practice: Start new conversation for new topics

2. Users sign up themselves
3. Join organization via invite code

**Method 2 (Admin Invite):**
1. Add to space with email
2. User receives invite link
3. Creates account to accept

### How do I manage permissions?

**Space-level permissions:**
1. Open space → **"Manage Space"**
2. View members list
3. Change roles:
   - **Admin**: Full control
   - **Writer**: Read/write
   - **Reader**: Read-only

2. Invalid token
3. JWT secret changed

**Solutions:**
1. Log out and log back in
2. Clear browser localStorage
3. Check `SUTRA_JWT_SECRET_KEY` consistency

### Messages not appearing

**Causes:**
1. Space filter applied
2. Search filter active
3. Permission issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check space selector (top left)
2. Clear search (if command palette open)
3. Verify you have read access to space

### Docker containers not starting

**Check logs:**
```bash
./sutra-deploy.sh logs sutra-api
./sutra-deploy.sh logs sutra-storage
```

**Common issues:**
- Port conflict: Change ports in `docker-compose-grid.yml`
- Memory limit: Increase Docker memory allocation
- Dependency: Check health checks pass

### UI not loading

**Quick fixes:**
1. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)
