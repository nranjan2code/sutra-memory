## 📊 Detailed Findings

### Strengths ✅
1. **Factual Learning**: 100% success with concrete facts
   - "The English alphabet has 26 letters"
   - "There are 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u"
   - "There are 21 consonants in English"

2. **Concept Formation**: Strong abstract understanding
   - Successfully learned what nouns and verbs are
   - Understood sentence components (subject, predicate)

3. **Association Building**: 372 associations created
   - Connected related concepts effectively
   - Showed emergent understanding in creative queries

4. **Hallucination Prevention**: 100% effective
   - System correctly rejected false information
   - Maintained 0% hallucination rate throughout

### Weaknesses ❌
1. **Example Learning**: 0% success with specific examples
   - Failed to learn "The cat sits"
   - Couldn't retain sentence examples

2. **Complex Patterns**: Lower confidence (47%) on:
   - Adjective definitions
   - Lists of examples
   - Specific sentence constructions

3. **Retrieval Precision**: Mixed results
   - Some queries returned related but not exact matches
   - Spelling rules were not successfully retrieved
