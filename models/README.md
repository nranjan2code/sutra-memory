# Models Directory

This directory contains trained models and model artifacts.

## Structure
- Save trained models here in appropriate subdirectories
- Use descriptive names for model files
- Include model metadata and configuration files alongside model weights

## Note
Large model files are ignored by git. Use appropriate model versioning tools like DVC or Git LFS for tracking model versions.
