# Sutra Core - Graph-Based Reasoning Engine

The foundational package for the Sutra AI system, providing graph-based reasoning with explainable AI capabilities.

## Features

- **Concept Management**: Adaptive strength learning for knowledge concepts
- **Association Networks**: Typed relationships between concepts (semantic, causal, temporal, hierarchical, compositional)  
- **Adaptive Learning**: Research-based adaptive focus learning (AdaKD-inspired)
- **Real-Time Integration**: Instant knowledge updates without retraining

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Concepts

```python
from sutra_core import Concept, Association, AssociationType

# Create a concept
concept = Concept(
    id="photosynthesis", 
    content="process by which plants convert light energy to chemical energy"
)

# Access strengthens the concept
concept.access()
print(f"Concept strength: {concept.strength}")
```

### Adaptive Learning

```python
from sutra_core.learning import AdaptiveLearner, AssociationExtractor
from collections import defaultdict

# Set up learning system
concepts = {}
associations = {}
word_to_concepts = defaultdict(set)
concept_neighbors = defaultdict(set)

extractor = AssociationExtractor(
    concepts, word_to_concepts, concept_neighbors, associations
)
learner = AdaptiveLearner(concepts, extractor)

# Learn new knowledge with adaptive focus
concept_id = learner.learn_adaptive(
    "Photosynthesis converts sunlight into glucose and oxygen",
    source="biology_textbook"
)
```

### Text Processing

```python
from sutra_core.utils import extract_words, get_association_patterns

# Extract meaningful words
words = extract_words("Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process")
print(words)  # ['photosynthesis', 'crucial', 'biological', 'process']

# Get association patterns
patterns = get_association_patterns()
for pattern, assoc_type in patterns:
    print(f"{assoc_type}: {pattern}")
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`graph/`**: Core data structures (Concept, Association, ReasoningPath)
- **`learning/`**: Adaptive learning algorithms and association extraction
- **`utils/`**: Text processing and utility functions

### Key Classes

#### Concept
Represents a knowledge unit with adaptive strength learning:
- Strength increases with access (max 10.0)
- Tracks usage statistics and metadata
- Serializable for persistence

#### Association  
Weighted connections between concepts:
- Multiple types: semantic, causal, temporal, hierarchical, compositional
- Confidence scoring for uncertainty handling
- Strengthens through use

#### AdaptiveLearner
Implements research-based adaptive focus:
- Difficult concepts (strength < 4.0): Strong reinforcement (1.15×)
- Easy concepts (strength > 7.0): Minimal reinforcement (1.01×)
- Dynamic extraction depth based on difficulty

## Research Foundation

Based on cutting-edge research:

- **Adaptive Focus Learning**: "LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation" (Oct 2025)
- **Loss-Driven Token Focusing**: More compute for difficult concepts
- **Dynamic Reinforcement**: Strength-based learning strategies

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Format code  
black sutra_core/
isort sutra_core/

# Type checking
mypy sutra_core/
```

## Performance

- **Memory**: ~0.1KB per concept
- **Learning**: ~1000 concepts/second
- **Access**: O(1) concept lookup via word indexing
- **Associations**: O(branches^depth) graph traversal
