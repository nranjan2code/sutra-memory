"""
Sutra AI Core - Graph-based reasoning system.

This is the core package for the Sutra AI system, providing:
- Concept and Association data structures
- Spreading activation reasoning algorithms
- Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA)
- Adaptive focus learning
- Real-time knowledge integration

The system offers a genuine alternative to LLM limitations:
- 100% explainable reasoning paths
- Real-time learning without retraining
- Unlimited persistent memory
- Ultra-efficient CPU-only operation
